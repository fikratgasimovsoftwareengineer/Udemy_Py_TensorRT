### This folder contains files on which yolov5 image batch object detection inference has been described with TensorRT Library

#### Attention...
### In order to implement this codes, you need to follow udemy course with docker file configurations in order to achieve library dependencies well built.


Folder structures is described as the following:
- images are contained in Images/
- models pretrained are inserted in directory of models/
- engine files are attached on the directory of models_engine
- inference.py file describes FAST yolov5 object  detection with tensorrt library.

```
